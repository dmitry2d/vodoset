# Old Databases workaround

Previous version (1.0) databases are located outside of this project.

This code chapter is a set of scripts to access and copy data to the new project version (2.0) databases

## Contants

### copy_users.js

- Access to V1.0 sql database dbo.Users
- Show this data in console
- Fill Users table with this data
